 		With your group write out the steps you would use "mathematically" to determine the answer to the following situation:
			Assuming:

				The first train of the day comes in at 3:00 AM.
			The train runs every 17 minutes
			The current time is 7:12 PM.
			There have been no delays and will be no delays.
			Question:

			How many minutes away is the next train?

		// Assume the following situations.

		// (TEST 1)
		// First Train of the Day is 3:00 AM
		// Assume Train comes every 3 minutes.
		// Assume the current time is 3:16 AM....
		// What time would the next train be...? (Use your brain first)
		// It would be 3:18 -- 2 minutes away

		// (TEST 2)
		// First Train of the Day is 3:00 AM
		// Assume Train comes every 7 minutes.
		// Assume the current time is 3:16 AM....
		// What time would the next train be...? (Use your brain first)
		// It would be 3:21 -- 5 minutes away


		// ==========================================================

		// Solved Mathematically
		// Test case 1:
		// 16 - 00 = 16
		// 16 % 3 = 1 (Modulus is the remainder)
		// 3 - 1 = 2 minutes away
		// 2 + 3:16 = 3:18

		// Solved Mathematically
		// Test case 2:
		// 16 - 00 = 16
		// 16 % 7 = 2 (Modulus is the remainder)
		// 7 - 2 = 5 minutes away
		// 5 + 3:16 = 3:21

		// Assumptions
		var tFrequency = 3;
		var firstTime = "03:30"; // Time is 3:30 AM

		// First Time (pushed back 1 year to make sure it comes before current time)
		var firstTimeConverted = moment(firstTime,"hh:mm").subtract(1, "years");
		console.log(firstTimeConverted);

		// Current Time
		var currentTime = moment();
		console.log("CURRENT TIME: " + moment(currentTime).format("hh:mm"));

		// Difference between the times
		var diffTime = moment().diff(moment(firstTimeConverted), "minutes");
		console.log("DIFFERENCE IN TIME: " + diffTime);

		// Time apart (remainder)
		var tRemainder = diffTime % tFrequency;
		console.log(tRemainder);

		// Minute Until Train
		var tMinutesTillTrain = tFrequency - tRemainder;
		console.log("MINUTES TILL TRAIN: " + tMinutesTillTrain);

		// Next Train
		var nextTrain = moment().add(tMinutesTillTrain, "minutes")
		console.log("ARRIVAL TIME: " + moment(nextTrain).format("hh:mm"))

		//var x = '01-01-2016'; 
		//moment().diff(moment(x), 'months') //calculate diff between now and months, returns 5
